    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My favourite cuisine is Indian Cuisine since it is probably the only cuisine I remember ever eating. It also is because I'm vegetarian and Indian Cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines which include spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. </p>

<h2>Most Common Dishes and Places</h2>
<p>Curry is one of India's most popular and well-known dishes. Tomato-based curries are known as the ultimate comfort food in India, and countries all over the world have adopted this opinion too.</p>

<p>Indian cuisine enjoys its presence across most of the sampled countries, but it is especially popular in United Kingdom, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Germany, France and US.</p>

<h2>Simular Cuisines</h2>
<p>India and Mexico share a similar kind of culture which is diverse and vibrant. Even though these countries are separated by seven oceans and some thousand miles, the food seems to not have such an extreme distance in terms of taste and flavours.</p>
